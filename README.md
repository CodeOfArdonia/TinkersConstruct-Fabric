# Supporoform

This is a fork of Tinker's Construct/Hephaestus, contains bug fixes and some slight modification for my modpack.

Also, this is a LTS version only for 1.20.1 fabric. So don't ask me for porting to other version, please use 
[Hephaestus](https://github.com/Alpha-s-Stuff/TinkersConstruct) instead.

## Fixes

- Casting Table will not drop casts and items correctly.
- Crash client when you open the gui provide by a broken smeltery.
- Some recipes cannot be used due to wrong tags.
- When throwing items directly in to smeltery it will wrongly stack.
- Crash server when wearing piglin/zombie_piglin head.
- Piggy backpack will make your chestplate disappear.
